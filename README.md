# basic-shopping-cart-with-Api-react-

This is a simple online shopping cart where you can add items to your cart and calculate the total cost. The items in the cart are fetched from an API and their names and prices are generated randomly. The application is developed using React concepts like props, useState, axios, useEffect, and incorporates some Bootstrap styling. It allows you to simulate the process of selecting and purchasing items without actual transactions taking place.
